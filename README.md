# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The following challenge involved creating a weather dashboard that utilized the OpenWeatherMap API. The application features a simple dashboard that allows the user to search the city to receive data on the current and 5-day forecast. Past search results appear on the side of the page and can be clicked on to display their forecast data again.

-	Displays current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
-	Displays city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
-	Click on a city in the search history to be present again with current and future conditions for that city
-	If input the User enters cannot be found, the user will be alerted to try again

The application was built primarily with Bootstrap and does not have a custom style sheet.
